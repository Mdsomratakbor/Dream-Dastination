Another old name was \"Palongkee\".</p>\r\n<p>The modern Cox\'s Bazar derives its name from Captain Hiram Cox, an officer of the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"British East India Company\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_East_India_Company\">British East India Company</a>.

(36, 28, 'Ahsan Manzil', '<p><strong>Ahsan Manzil</strong>&nbsp; was the official residential palace and seat of the Nawab of Dhaka. The building is situated at Kumartoli along the banks of the Buriganga River in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Construction was started in 1859 and was completed in 1872. It was constructed in the <span class=\"mw-redirect\">Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture</span>. It has been designated as a national museum.<a title=\"Nawab of Dhaka\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nawab_of_Dhaka\">Nawab of Dhaka</a>.</p>\r\n<p>In Mughal era, there was a garden house of Sheikh Enayet Ullah, the landlord of Jamalpur Porgona (district), in this place. Sheikh Enayet Ullah was a very charming person. He acquired a very big area in Kumortuli (Kumartuli) and included it in his garden house. Here he built a beautiful palace and named it \"Rongmohol\" (Rangmahal). He used to enjoy here keeping beautiful girls collected from the country and abroad, dressing them with gorgeous dresses and expensive ornaments. There is a saying that, the foujdar of Dhaka (representative of mughal emperor) was attracted to one of the beautiful girls. He invited Sheikh Enayet Ullah to a party one night and killed him in a conspiracy when he was returning home. That girl also committed suicide in anger and sorrow. There was a grave of Sheikh Enayet Ullah in the north-east corner of the palace yard which was ruined in the beginning of the 20th century.</p>\r\n<p>Probably in the period of Nawab Alibardi Khan around 1740 century, Sheikh Moti Ullah, the son of Sheikh Enayet Ullah, sold the property to the French traders. There was a French trading house beside this property. The trading house became wealthier after purchasing this property. In that time, French traders could do business here without paying any taxes by a decree from the emperor Aurangzeb. In that time, the French became very wealthy by doing business here in competition with the English and other European companies. They made a big palace and dug a pond for sweet water in the newly purchased property. The pond still exists in the compound of Ahsan Manzil which was called \"Les Jalla\" in that time. In the English-French war, French got defeated and all their properties were captured by the English. On 22 June 1757, the French left the trading house with a fleet of 35 boats from the river station of Buriganga in front of Kumartuli.</p>\r\n<p>In 1785, the French transferred the property to a French tradesman named Mr. Champigni, and retaken it at 1801. According to Paris agreement of 1814, the French claimed all their left properties at Dhaka, and in 1827 the property was again returned to the French. For the increasing power of the English, the French was forced to leave subcontinent. They decided to sell all their properties in Dhaka. So in 1830, the trading house of Kumartuli was purchased by the established landlord of Dhaka Khwaja Alimullah.</p>\r\n<p>After some renovation work, the trading house became the residence of Khwaja Alimullah. In his time, a stable and a family mosque was added in the compound. After his death, his son Khwaja Abdul Gani made a great flourish to the property, and named it \"Ahsan Manjil\" on his son Ahsan Ullah. In the east side of the old building, he made a new building with a different design, and also done great renovation work to the old building. Since then, the old building was called \"Ondor Mohol\" and the new building was called \"Rong mohol\".</p>\r\n<p>In the evening of 7 April 1888, a devastating tornado hit Dhaka city causing great damage. Ahsan Manjil was severely damaged and abandoned. An English engineer from Kolkata arrived here to examine the palace. He gave opinion that except for the \"Rangmahal\", all the other parts of the palace would have to be reconstructed. So Khwaja Abdul Gani and his son Ahsanullah turned their full attention to rebuild the palace. Both of the buildings were reconstructed during that time with a new design and supervised by the local engineer Gobinda Chandra Roy.</p>\r\n<p>The old French building was reconstructed to a two storied building keeping similarity to the Rangmahal. A gangway was made with wood connecting the first floors of the two buildings. The most beautiful thing made in this time was the dome, which made the palace so beautiful.</p>\r\n<p>After the death of Khwaja Ahsanullah in 1901, the glory of Ahsan Manjil was ended. His successors couldn&rsquo;t continue the glory because of the internal family quarrel. They rented different parts of the palace to tenants, who actually made it a slum. In 1952, govt. acquired the property and left in supervision of the Dhaka Nawab court. In 1985, Dhaka National Museum acquired the property and made it a museum following a massive restoration programme which utilised historic photographs of the property.<a title=\"Buriganga River\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buriganga_River\">Buriganga River</a></p>', 'upload/5fb680f06d.jpg', 'Admin', 'Ahsan Manzil', 'Ahsan Manzil', '2019-05-01 20:52:13', 11),

But an over-enthusiastic and zealous merchant named Ali Jan Bepari completely remodeled and reconstructed it with extremely delicate and richly colored tiles of variegated patterns. Ali Jan has added the new verandah, that is mentioned in the introduction, on the east and spent lavishly on importing Japanese and English decorated China clay tiles to improve the inner and outer show of the mosque. It is now a five-domed structure. In 1987, two domes have been raised on an extension to the northern side without any respect to its antiquity, architectural style, and decoration.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h2><span id=\"Architecture\" class=\"mw-headline\">Architecture</span></h2>\r\n<p>Built in the Mughal style by Mirza Ghulam in the late 18th century, this mosque was originally a simple rectangular mosque, measuring 33\' x 11\' with three doorways on the east fa&ccedil;ade (main fa&ccedil;ade) and one on the north wall and another on the south wall. Three domes crowned the mosque, the central one being the larger. Towers accented the corners and the fa&ccedil;ades displayed plastered panel decoration. In early 20th century, Ali Jan Bepari financed its renovation when a front verandah was added. The surface was redone in \'Chini Tikri\', a popular broken china decoration. The mosque is one of the very few examples of exclusive chinitikri mosaic, found in the striking blue star mosaic, which gave the mosque its name Star Mosque. In 1987, the prayer hall was extended by the Department of Architecture to include two more domes.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Mosque#cite_note-2\">[2]</a></sup> It was decorated with imported china clay tiles and used both methods of applying chinitikri and used solid colour, cur clay tiles and formed patterns by placing the coloured tiles in white plaster. The domes and the exterior are covered with different coloured star shaped china clay tiles. The upper portion of the eastern fa&ccedil;ade also incorporates a crescent motif. The work assumed another texture by using assorted glazed tiles on the interior. The three mihrabs and the doorways are decorated with mosaic floral pattern. A plant and vase motif is repeated as a decorative element on the pendentive and the interior of the verandah wall.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h3><span id=\"Exterior_decoration\" class=\"mw-headline\">Exterior decoration</span></h3>\r\n<p>In early 20th century, Ali Jan Bepari, a local businessman, financed the renovation of the mosque and added a new eastern verandah. The surface was redecorated with Chinitikri work (mosaic work of broken China porcelain pieces), a decorative style that was popular during the 1930s. The mosque, which previously lacked any historical significance, is one of the few remaining architectural example of the Chinitikri (Chinese pieces) method of mosaic decoration. This decorative technique is found in the striking star motif that is in part the reason for the mosque\'s current acclaim and popular name, Star Mosque or Sitara Masjid. In 1987, the Ministry of Religious Affairs commissioned Giasul Huque and Zahiruddin to make additions to the prayer hall, which was extended to include two more domes.</p>\r\n<p>The mosque is decorated with Japanese and English china clay tiles and used both methods of the Chinitikri application.

There was a small agricultural community in between <a title=\"Pilkhana, Bangladesh\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilkhana,_Bangladesh\">Pilkhana</a> and Jafarbad where the Sat Gambuj Mosque was built. The area became like a jungle due to disuse, dereliction, and desertion mainly during the British period. However, in last 55 years, it has become one of the most planned and most expensive residential enclaves of Dhaka. The <a title=\"Sat Masjid Road\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sat_Masjid_Road\">Sat Masjid Road</a> is the major peripheral road of the district to its west and is believed to have been built roughly along where the old Bank river <a title=\"Turag River\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turag_River\">Turag</a> was.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sat_Gambuj_Mosque#cite_note-2\">[2]</a></sup></p>\r\n<h2><span id=\"Structure\" class=\"mw-headline\">Structure</span></h2>\r\n<p>Picturesquely situated on the edge of a river, the Sat Gambuj Mosque\'s exterior is the most innovative of all the Dhaka Mughal-period <a title=\"Monument\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monument\">monuments</a>. The north and south ends of this three-domed rectangular mosque are each marked by two enormous double-storied corner pavilions; when viewed from the east these give the impression that the mosque has five exterior bays. On the east are three cusped entrances arches flanked by shallow niches. Slender engaged columns with bulbous bases demarcate the central bay (as seen as the <a title=\"Lalbagh Fort\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lalbagh_Fort\">Lalbagh Fort</a> Mosque, although this mosque\'s colonettes are more prominent).</p>\r\n<p>Its interior compares favourably with that of others dating to the second half of the 17th century. The central <a title=\"Mihrab\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihrab\">mihrab</a> has two rows of cusping, and its surface is embellished with moulded plaster relief, recalling the ornateness of the mihrab in the mosque of Haji Khwaja Shahbaz.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sat_Gambuj_Mosque#cite_note-3\">[3]</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>It used forms shapes &mdash; octagon, square, rectangle and circle &mdash; all beautifully juxtaposed. Besides the typical three domes on the main prayer hall, there are four hollow double-storey domed corner towers that gave rise to its name (Seven-Domed Mosque). The corner <a title=\"Turret\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turret\">turret</a> provided structural stability and visual balance to the 38\'&times;27\' building on a river bank and was probably used as viewing galleries for enjoying the river. The upper level of the octagonal turrets starts from around half the height of the main prayer hall. Both levels have arched panels and windows, surmounted by <a title=\"Cornice\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornice\">cornice</a> and capped by domes with kalasha (pitcher) <a title=\"Finial\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finial\">finials</a> planted on lotus base.</p>\r\n<p>Otherwise with a bigger dome in the middle flanked by two smaller ones, the mosque bears all the characteristic features of Shaista Khani style. However, though the <a title=\"Qibla\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qibla\">qibla</a> facades of most such buildings remain unadorned, that of the Sat Gambuj Mosque is decorated with recessions within moulded panels, the middle portion delineated by two slender <a title=\"Pilaster\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilaster\">pilasters</a> slightly protruding. These are much bigger than those usually seen at the front. The three central panels have an arch-shape on the lower part.</p>\r\n<p>The mosque has three cusped entrance arches, the middle one being taller and edged with multi-foil arch, a late-Mughal refinement, flanked by shallow niches and rectangular panels and echoed by mihrabs on the qibla wall, slender engaged pilasters with bulbous base demarcating the central bay, mihrab surface embellished with moulded plaster relief, corner turret stretched above <a title=\"Merlon\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merlon\">merlon</a> parapet with pinnacles, single, openings on side walls, etc.</p>\r\n<p>The side entrances have mere decoration applied to their external faces some of which may not be original. All these elements emphasize the symmetrical and axial arrangement along with the central dome and the mihrab. The style is very common among most of the surviving historic mosques of Dhaka. Built on a spacious and solid podium, it has many elements resembling those in Khwaja Shahbaz Mosque, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Khan Muhammad Mirdha\'s Mosque\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khan_Muhammad_Mirdha%27s_Mosque\">Khan Muhammad Mirdha\'s Mosque</a>, and the mosque inside the Lalbagh Fort.</p>\r\n<p>The heights of the entrances and other openings have been distorted or dwarfed by elevation of the plinth level as the ground around was constantly elevated to remain above flood level. However, the two slender pinnacles rising on both sides of the panel provide a kind of vertically to this otherwise horizontal and stout structure. This element achieved a level of perfection and hence elegance in the Mridha\'s Mosque built quarter of a century later. There are eight small panels on each side of the door, all of which are enclose arched niches. The transition from the square to the circle of the dome base is made by <a title=\"Pendentive\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendentive\">pendentives</a>. However, the domes are conventional, rest on octagonal drum shoulder, embellished with blind merlons. The brick lime walls of the naturally cool structures are 4 feet deep.</p>\r\n<p>There is a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Graveyard\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graveyard\">graveyard</a> in front of the mosque used as late as the 1950s.

It is considered the oldest museum in Bangladesh. It was the first museum to be established in East Bengal in 1910. The museum started out as the collection for Varendra Anushandan Samiti (or Varendra Investigation Society) and got its current name in 1919. The Rajahs of Rajshahi and Natore, notably prince Sharat Kumar Ray, donated their personal collections to Varendra Museum. Varendra refers to an ancient Janapada roughly corresponding to modern northern Bangladesh.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h2><span id=\"History\" class=\"mw-headline\">History</span></h2>\r\n<p>Varendra (or Barind) was a region of Bengal, now in Bangladesh. It included the Pundravardhana or Pundra Kingdom region. According to Cunningham the boundary of Varendra was the Ganges and the Mahananda on the west, the Karatoya on the east, the Padma on the south, and the land between Koochbihar and the Terai on the north. The Varendra Brahmins originated from this region.</p>\r\n<p>Ancient Bengal did not have any Brahmins in its community. It is popularly believed that Brahmins were brought in to preach Hindutva, though really not the Vedic Hinduism as it is commonly believed, but more of the Pouranik Hinduism type, which evolved after Buddhism flourished. This Pouranik Hinduism is what we know as Brahmanism. Varendra (Barendra) Bhumi, i.e., modern-day North Bengal, had its Brahminism awakening soon after the south got its share. Shyamal Varma, a Kshatriya King brought five Brahmanas from Kanouj &mdash; Sanaka, Bhardwaja, Savarna, Sandilya, and Vasistha. The Bhatariya, Maitreya, Satar, Baghshree and Laheria villages soon gave birth to the Brahmin clans of Bhaduri, Moitra, Sanyal, Bagchi and Lahiri. These came to be known as the Varendra (Barendra) Brahmins.</p>\r\n<p>The settlement of Varendra, spoken as Janakabhu (fatherland), was one of the most flourishing territories of the ancient Indian sub-continent. Literary and epigraphic evidence show that a separate school of artisans earned wide reputation here at the reign of Pala dynasty and the streams of art making were uninterrupted until the Sena dynasty.</p>\r\n<p>Some of the leading and enlightened citizens of Rajshahi felt the necessity and justification of establishing such an institution that would explore the precious past of this region. Henceforth, \'The Varendra Research Society\' was established in 1910. The founder of the society, Kumar Sarat Kumar Ray, the scion of the Dighapatiya Royal family accompanied by Aksaya Kumar Maitreya, a leading lawyer and renowned historian; <a title=\"Ramaprasad Chanda\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramaprasad_Chanda\">Ramaprasad Chanda</a>, a reputed scholar in history, art and archaeology; and others explored archaeological and historical artefacts excavated in villages of Rajshahi.</p>\r\n<p>The conviction grew in Kumar\'s mind if a centre of archaeological research was to be established at Rajshahi, the finds should be preserved there as the nucleus of a local museum. Accordingly, to collect, preserve, study and research the history and culture of ancient and medieval Bangal in general, and of Varendra region in particular, three worthy sons of the soil mentioned above took the effort to establish a museum.</p>\r\n<p>The Varendra Research Society and Museum was set up at Rajshahi in 1910. It is the premier institution of its kind and the splendid accomplishment of its organisation in Bangladesh. The role of the society concerning the museum was that of proprietor and caretaker. However, this was formally inaugurated on 27 September 1910 and was registered in 1914 in accordance with the Indian Society Act, 1860.</p>\r\n<p>Varendra Museum was the first museum to be established in erstwhile <a title=\"East Bengal\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Bengal\">East Bengal</a> in 1910.

Also the Archaeological sites were found recently and the artefacts are increasing day by day. The restoration program of existing museum has already begun.

Larger part is situated in Bangladesh, a smaller portion of it lies in India. The Indian part of the forest is estimated to be about 40 percent, while the Bangladeshi part is 60 percent. To the south the forest meets the Bay of Bengal; to the east it is bordered by the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Baleswar River\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baleswar_River\">Baleswar River</a> and to the north there is a sharp interface with intensively cultivated land. The natural drainage in the upstream areas, other than the main river channels, is everywhere impeded by extensive embankments and <a title=\"Polder\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polder\">polders</a>. The Sundarbans was originally measured (about 200 years ago) to be of about 16,700 square kilometres (6,400&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi). Now it has dwindled into about 1/3 of the original size. The total land area today is 4,143 square kilometres (1,600&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi), including exposed <a class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sandbar\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbar\">sandbars</a> with a total area of 42 square kilometres (16&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi); the remaining water area of 1,874 square kilometres (724&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) encompasses rivers, small streams and canals. Rivers in the Sundarbans are meeting places of salt water and freshwater. Thus, it is a region of transition between the freshwater of the rivers originating from the Ganges and the saline water of the Bay of Bengal.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Wahid_19-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundarbans#cite_note-Wahid-19\">[19]</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>The Sundarbans along the Bay of Bengal has evolved over the millennia through natural deposition of upstream sediments accompanied by intertidal segregation. The physiography is dominated by deltaic formations that include innumerable drainage lines associated with surface and subaqueous levees, splays and tidal flats. There are also marginal marshes above mean tide level, tidal sandbars and islands with their networks of tidal channels, subaqueous distal bars and proto-delta clays and silt sediments. The Sundarbans\' floor varies from 0.9 to 2.11 metres (3.0 to 6.9&nbsp;ft) above sea level.<sup id=\"cite_ref-20\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundarbans#cite_note-20\">[20]</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Biotic factors here play a significant role in physical coastal evolution, and for <a title=\"Wildlife\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife\">wildlife</a> a variety of <a title=\"Habitat\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat\">habitats</a> have developed which include beaches, estuaries, permanent and semi-permanent swamps, tidal flats, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Tidal creek\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_creek\">tidal creeks</a>, coastal dunes, back dunes and levees. The mangrove vegetation itself assists in the formation of new landmass and the intertidal vegetation plays a significant role in swamp morphology. The activities of mangrove fauna in the intertidal mudflats develop <a title=\"Micromorphological\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micromorphological\">micromorphological</a> features that trap and hold sediments to create a substratum for mangrove seeds. The morphology and evolution of the <a title=\"Aeolian processes\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeolian_processes\">eolian</a> dunes is controlled by an abundance of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Xerophytic\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerophytic\">xerophytic</a> and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Halophytic\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halophytic\">halophytic</a> plants. Creepers, grasses and sedges stabilise sand dunes and uncompacted sediments. The Sunderbans mudflats (Banerjee, 1998) are found at the estuary and on the deltaic islands where low velocity of river and tidal current occurs. The flats are exposed in low tides and submerged in high tides, thus being changed morphologically even in one tidal cycle. The tides are so large that approximately one third of the land disappears and reappears every day.<sup id=\"cite_ref-21\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundarbans#cite_note-21\">[21]</a></sup> The interior parts of the mudflats serve as a perfect home for mangroves.</p>\r\n<div class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">See also: <a title=\"List of rivers of Sundarbans\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_rivers_of_Sundarbans\">List of rivers of Sundarbans</a></div>\r\n<h2><span id=\"Ecoregions\" class=\"mw-headline\">Ecoregions</span></h2>\r\n<p>Sundarbans features two <a title=\"Ecoregion\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecoregion\">ecoregions</a> &mdash; \"Sundarbans freshwater swamp forests\" (IM0162) and \"Sundarbans mangroves\" (IM1406).<sup id=\"cite_ref-22\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundarbans#cite_note-22\">[22]</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3><span id=\"Sundarbans_freshwater_swamp_forests\" class=\"mw-headline\">Sundarbans freshwater swamp forests</span></h3>\r\n<p>The Sundarbans freshwater swamp forests are a <a title=\"Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_and_subtropical_moist_broadleaf_forests\">tropical moist broadleaf forest</a> ecoregion of Bangladesh.

Most importantly, mangroves are a transition from the marine to freshwater and terrestrial systems, and provide critical habitat for numerous species of small fish, crabs, shrimps and other crustaceans that adapt to feed and shelter, and reproduce among the tangled mass of roots, known as <a class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Pneumatophore\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumatophore\">pneumatophores</a>, which grow upward from the anaerobic mud to get the supply of oxygen. <a title=\"Fishing cat\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing_cat\">Fishing cats</a>, <a title=\"Macaque\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macaque\">macaques</a>, <a title=\"Wild boar\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_boar\">wild boars</a>, common grey mongooses, foxes, <a title=\"Jungle cat\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungle_cat\">jungle cats</a>, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Flying fox\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_fox\">flying foxes</a>, <a title=\"Pangolin\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangolin\">pangolins</a>, and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Spotted deer\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotted_deer\">spotted deer</a> are also found in abundance in the Sundarbans.</p>\r\n<p>A 1991 study has revealed that the Indian part of the Sundarbans supports diverse biological resources including at least 150 species of commercially important fish, 270 species of birds, 42 species of mammals, 35 reptiles and 8 amphibian species, although new ones are being discovered. This represents a significant proportion of the species present in Bangladesh (i.e. about 30% of the reptiles, 37% the birds and 34% of the mammals) and includes many species which are now extinct elsewhere in the country.<sup id=\"cite_ref-34\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundarbans#cite_note-34\">[34]</a></sup> Two amphibians, 14 reptiles, 25 aves and five mammals are endangered.<sup id=\"cite_ref-sarakar_35-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundarbans#cite_note-sarakar-35\">[35]</a></sup> The Sundarbans is an important wintering area for migrant water birds<sup id=\"cite_ref-36\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundarbans#cite_note-36\">[36]</a></sup> and is an area suitable for watching and studying avifauna.<sup id=\"cite_ref-37\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundarbans#cite_note-37\">[37]</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>The management of wildlife is restricted to, firstly, the protection of fauna from poaching, and, secondly, designation of some areas as wildlife sanctuaries where no extraction of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Forest produce\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_produce\">forest produce</a> is allowed and where the wildlife face few disturbances.

Of these, the tiger and dolphin are target species for planning wildlife management and tourism development. There are high profile and vulnerable mammals living in two contrasting environments, and their statuses and management are strong indicators of the general condition and management of wildlife. Some species are protected by legislation, notably by the Bangladesh Wildlife (Preservation) Order, 1973 (P.O. 23 of 1973).<sup id=\"cite_ref-38\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundarbans#cite_note-38\">[38]</a></sup></p>\r\n<h3><span id=\"Mammals\" class=\"mw-headline\">Mammals</span></h3>\r\n<p>The fertile soils of the delta have been subject to intensive human use for centuries, and the ecoregion has been mostly converted to intensive agriculture, with few enclaves of forest remaining.

A major part of this geography lasted till historical times. The loss of the jungle was due to human activity. Bengal had an early human presence. But there is no consensus for the timeframe of the first human activity in Bengal nor are there plenty of remains. One view contends that humans entered Bengal from China 60,000 years ago. Another view claims that a distinct regional culture emerged 100,000 years ago. There is weak evidence for a prehistoric human presence in the region.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Willem_van_Schendel_11_16-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Bangladesh#cite_note-Willem_van_Schendel_11-16\">[16]</a></sup> There is scant evidence of a human presence during the Neolithic and Chalcolithic eras.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Baxter_1997_12_15-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Bangladesh#cite_note-Baxter_1997_12-15\">[15]</a></sup> This could be because of the shifts in the rivers\' courses.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Baxter_1997_12_15-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Bangladesh#cite_note-Baxter_1997_12-15\">[15]</a></sup> The Bengali climate and geography is not suitable for tangible archaeological remains. Due to lack of stones the early humans in Bengal probably used materials such as wood and bamboo that could not survive in the environment. South Asian archaeologists have tended to focus on other parts of the subcontinent. Archaeologists interested in Bengal have focused on more recent history.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Willem_van_Schendel_11_16-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Bangladesh#cite_note-Willem_van_Schendel_11-16\">[16]</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Archaeological discoveries are almost entirely from the hills around the Bengal delta. West Bengal and Bangladesh\'s eastern terrain offer the best source of information about the early peoples of Bengal. Industries of fossilwood manufacturing blades, scrapers and axes have been discovered in Lalmai, Sitakund and Chaklapunji. These have been connected with similar findings in Burma and West Bengal. Large stones, thought to be prehistoric, were constructed in north eastern Bangladesh and are similar to those in India\'s nearby hills. Farming was practised before the first millennium BCE.

Local rulers retained power while paying tribute to the Gupta Empire in the 300s and 400s. The Bengal delta became the kingdom of Samatata; its hub near the contemporary Chandpur. A Gupta inscription indicates that the Gupta empire possessed influence in Samatata without ruling it directly. Bengal remained a frontier despite its rare associations with the Indian heartland. Several dynasties changed during the next few centuries. While not much information is available about them, plates and other forms of evidence obtained from the Comilla district indicate that Gopachandra ruled the area in the early 500s.

The authority of the Senas persisted in Vikrampur till 1245 and a large part of eastern Bangladesh had neither been conquered nor converted.<sup id=\"cite_ref-43\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Bangladesh#cite_note-43\">[43]</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Four dynasties based in Delhi succeeded the Slave dynasty. The Khaljis ruled from 1290 to 1320. The Tughluq dynasty\'s rule lasted until 1413. Sayyid rule ran from 1414 to 1451. The Lodhi dynasty ruled in the 1451-1526 period. But the writ of the Delhi Sultanate had been weak in its outer regions and Bengal like other similar areas turned into an independent region.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Baxter_1997_18_44-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Bangladesh#cite_note-Baxter_1997_18-44\">[44]</a></sup> Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah became the ruler of independent Bengal in 1342 and his dynasty ruled until 1486, barring a short interlude. He had come to power after a Bengali revolt against the Tughluq dynasty\'s governor. Shamsuddin\'s state was based in Pandua, modern-day Malda district. Shamsuddin drove up the Ganges to contest Tughluq rule. The Tughluqs, in return drove Ilyas Shah out of Pandua into eastern Bengal. Shamsuddin reclaimed Pandua and continued ruling Bengal. Shamsuddin\'s heir repelled Tughluq incursions and like his predecessor expanded the dynasty\'s authority into Bihar.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Baxter_1997_18_44-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Bangladesh#cite_note-Baxter_1997_18-44\">[44]</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>The dynasty constructed grand buildings in Pandua.

Raja Ganesh, who was a Hindu feudal, had become the most powerful personality at the Ilyas Shahi court. In 1414 he used the successor-ship conflict to seize control of Bengal. He repelled an incursion on Bengal by the Jaunpur sultanate in north India. His son, who embraced Islam, and then his grandson ruled after him. In 1433 the latter was assassinated and the Ilyas Shahi dynasty was restored.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Baxter_1997_18_44-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Bangladesh#cite_note-Baxter_1997_18-44\">[44]</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>The dynasty began importing Abyssinian slaves. This population became more significant. They became so important that in 1486 an Abyssinian, Barbak Shahzada, seized power from Jalaluddin Fateh Shah. Barbak Shahzada\'s dynasty was short, lasting for the next seven years.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Baxter_1997_18_44-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Bangladesh#cite_note-Baxter_1997_18-44\">[44]</a></sup> The last Abyssinian ruler, Shamsuddin Muzaffar Shah, lost power to the Arab principal minister, Alauddin Husain.<sup id=\"cite_ref-45\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Bangladesh#cite_note-45\">[45]</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>The initiation in 1493 of the Hussain Shahi dynasty brought a period which has been considered Bengal\'s golden age.
